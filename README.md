# My Resume website
For Codeinstitute's User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project.

# About:
This is a resume website I've made to present to prospective employers. In addition to my working and education experience, 
I have included some information about myself. In later stages I intend to expand upon this website by showcasing
a growing portfolio as I progress through the course.

# Technologies used:
HTML
CSS
Bootstrap

# UX:
My goal was to make a simple resume website that would showcase my education and experience, as well as give a small impression of 
who I am/my likes/interests. I've used a vibrant landing page in contrast with the relatively toned down content. My intention was to 
have a sleek minimalist surveyable design while still retaining a splash of personality or "flair". The navbar adds to the overall unique look. 
I have also added a small logo (letter M) for a more personalized touch.
The website is pretty self-explanatory in design. I have a section with with a brief overview of myself/my interests and my 
previous job experiences. 
Links to my Instagram, GithUb and LinkedIn profiles are also provided.


# Things I'd like to add in the future:
I would like to add a section to showcase my coding skills and include a new section for a portfolio. Also, as I advance 
through the course I do intend to (re)write certain parts with a cleaner code.

# Testing:
All my social media profiles can be accessed via clicking on the icons in the footer. The user can also obtain a printable version of 
my CV by clickinng on the orange button in the resume section. I have also included clickable links in the profile section that
redirect to spotify or goodreads. The links, as well as the CV will open in a new window by means of 'target="_blank". 
All the clickable paths have been tested so as to ensure they open the correct website.

I have tested the website on multiple browsers (including Chrome, IE and FireFox) and on multiple devices (laptop with MPDI screen, 
Galaxy S5, Pixel 2, Pixel 2XL, iphone 6/7/8, iphone 6/7/8 Plus, iPad and iPad Pro) to ensure the compatibility and responsiveness. All devices,
bar laptops, have been tested in both portrait and landscape mode. 

I did encounter some problems when scaling the content for ipad and ipad pro (portrait modes). The specific nature of the navigation 
bar required several media queries to address the severe overlap with the content on narrow screens. 

At present, one technical issue still persists which I've not been able to resolve. This has to do with the transition property 
of the navigation bar (in iPad Pro Portrait view). It works when opening the menu, but not when closing.
This issue will be addressed in the future.


# Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages: https://github.com/Marshmello88/project_one 
Any further updates will be automatically applied whenever the local changes are pushed to the remote GitHub-hosted repo. 
After this, the GitHub site should update within a few seconds. 

# Content
All content on this webpage has been written by me.

# Media
The landing page picture was taken from the following website:

# Acknowledgement
The navigation bar was modeled after the example found on the following website:
1. https://oneoneriga.lv/. 
I have used the following resume websites as examples for the structure of my own website:
1. Grade 5 example from the milestone project module for wireframing ideas.
2. http://www.pascalvangemert.nl/ 
I have also recycled some code in the about-me section from the Mini Resume Project with Bootstrap 4.


This is for educational use.
